  I.  Grading
      A.  Grading Scale:  A= 100 - 90   B= 89 - 80   C= 79 - 70   D=69 - 60   F= 59 and below
      B.  Course-specific grading policies 
            i.  For a detailed breakdown, see the section titled "IV.  How Grades are Earned", below.
           ii.  Detailed rubrics will be provided for all projects. 
          iii.  Our class follows college policies. Late work is not accepted, and retakes are not provided.
      C.  In cases where district grading policies conflict with college grading policies, the high school and college grades may differ; this may include assignment/test retakes, extended assignment due dates, capped minimum grade allowed, among other such district policies. 
      E.  It is important that students check their final NOVA grades in SIS as soon as their course is completed.
      F.  Course Grade Appeals
            i.  Students who think that a semester grade is in error should contact the instructor immediately to present their concerns.  Students who wish to appeal their grade or otherwise report a grievance will need to submit Form 125-021 within 20 days of the end of the semester.  The original grade will stand if the student delays in submitting their appeal.
           ii.  NOVA’s Student Grievance policy can be found here:  https://www.nvcc.edu/policies/_files/608-Student-Grievances.pdf
          iii.  Form 125-021 can be found here: https://www.nvcc.edu/forms/

 II.  Course Policies
      A.  Student Rights and Responsibilities
           i.  Students should be familiar with the college's specific expectations concerning the conduct of its students. These expectations apply to all students, including Dual Enrollment students.
          ii.  Student Rights and Responsibilities are outlined in the Student Code of Conduct, found here: https://www.nvcc.edu/students/handbook/conduct.html
      B.  Academic Integrity
            i.  NOVA promotes and emphasizes the importance of honesty in academic work. It is therefore imperative for students to maintain the highest standard of honor in their scholastic work. Academic dishonesty, as outlined in more detail in the Academic Integrity Policy (Policy Number: 224), can include, but is not limited to cheating on an exam or quiz, submitting work that is not your own (plagiarism), or sharing assessments online. Consequences of academic dishonesty can include a failing grade on an assignment, a failing grade in the course, and may include additional administrative sanctions such as suspension or expulsion from the college. Procedures for disciplinary measures and appeals are outlined in the Academic Integrity Procedures. It is a student’s responsibility to become familiar with the student code of conduct. Lack of awareness is no excuse for noncompliance with NOVA’s policies and procedures. 
           ii.   NOVA Faculty may choose to use tools, such as Turnitin, to detect and flag instances of plagiarism in academic writing. These tools can also identify text written by artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including ChatGPT, and flag it as potential plagiarism. The use of AI to complete assigned work may be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy. Students are urged to be cautious when using any web tools designed to assist with assignments without their instructors’ explicit permission to do so and should cite their sources in all their work. 
          iii.  Violating the Academic Integrity Policy will incur consequences. Your instructor may give you a failing grade for the assignment or for the course. Additionally, you may be referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) or the Academic Dean. If found responsible, your name will be entered into the tracking database and the consequences of another violation will be more severe. 
      C.  Accommodations and Accessibility Services
           i. NOVA is committed to ensuring all students have an opportunity to pursue a college education regardless of the presence or absence of a disability. Information on NOVA’s Accommodations and Accessibility Services, including how to reach a Accommodations and Accessibility Services counselor, can be found here:  https://www.nvcc.edu/accommodations.
          ii. Students must reach out to contact NOVA’s Accommodations and Accessibility Services to apply for accommodations. A student with a 504 plan or IEP at their high school will still need to apply with NOVA’s Accommodations and Accessibility Services – those plans do not automatically carry over to your Dual Enrollment course.  If accommodations are agreed upon, students will receive a Memorandum of Accommodation (MOA) by AAS.  The DE student must then provide the MOA to their DE instructor. All information is kept confidential and may increase your chances of success in the academic setting.
       D.  Advocacy and Privacy of Student Records
             i.  Students are expected to reach out to their instructor if they do not understand content or expectations. 
            ii.  You, as a NOVA student, have a right to review your NOVA grades and other records.  Your high school may share grades and other records with NOVA, and NOVA will share your post-secondary (college) grades with your high school.  The grades you earn at NOVA are part of a permanent transcript, and you will be required to include your NOVA transcript as part of any future college or graduate school application.  NOVA instructors and other college personnel generally may not release a student’s educational records without written consent of the student.  For dual enrolled students under 18, parents or guardians may generally access records and grades which are created by or shared with a student’s high school.  For the purposes of these privacy rules, your Dual Enrollment instructor is considered a NOVA employee.
           iii.  To grant parents or guardians direct access to NOVA records, students will be required to submit a notarized copy of NOVA Form 125-356, found here: https://www.nvcc.edu/forms/pdf/125-356.pdf.
            iv.  For more information about student privacy, parent limitations of access to students’ educational records, and other restrictions on sharing students’ personally identifiable information, please review NOVA Policy 613 (FERPA): https://www.nvcc.edu/policies/_files/613-FERPA.pdf.
       E.  Campus Services
           i.  Dual enrolled students have access to full NOVA campus services to include tutoring, library, and counseling services; student resources are found here: http://www.nvcc.edu/students/index.html.
       F.  Office of Wellness and Mental Health
           i.  During your time at NOVA, you may experience challenges including struggles with academics, finances, or your personal well-being. NOVA has support resources available. If you are seeking resources and support or if you are worried about a friend or classmate: https://www.nvcc.edu/wellness/index.html.
       G.  Course Drop and Withdrawal Policy 
            i.  Please note two important dates related to your enrollment in a course:
                a.  The “Drop” date (also known as census date) for a course is the last day to drop a course.  Dropping a course before the drop date will not appear on your NOVA transcript.
                b.  The “Withdrawal” date is the last day to withdraw without a grade penalty.  Dropping a course after the drop date and before the withdrawal date will result in a ‘W’ grade appearing on your transcript.
                c.  To identify these dates for your dual enrollment course, please see below on the ‘Course Schedule’ chart or log into your myNOVA account and SIS.
           ii.  Withdrawal Process
                a.  Dual enrolled students are responsible for requesting to drop or withdraw from their DE classes, using Form 125-03, found at the following link: https://dashboard.nvcc.edu/Forms/125-03
                b.  Dual enrolled students will use their myNOVA credentials to access the withdrawal form and will select one or more enrolled DE classes to withdraw.
                c.  The withdrawal form is then routed to the assigned DE instructor and the Office of Dual Enrollment for review and approval.
                d.  Check your VCCS email for the status of your request.
       H.  Communication
           i.  Students are required to use their VCCS email accounts (_____@email.vccs.edu) to communicate with college personnel and should check their email accounts regularly. Students may access their VCCS email accounts through myNOVA.	 	
       I.  Title IX
           i.  Title IX is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs, activities, admission and employment. Complaints of sex-based discrimination, sexual violence, domestic violence, and sexual or gender-based harassment are governed by the Title IX Policy. For more information about Title IX or to make a report: https://www.nvcc.edu/titleix/index.html.  

III.  Additional Course Information
      A.  DE students are expected to engage in college level course content and discussions appropriate for adult learners. Mature topics may be discussed. 
      B.  Attendance: Per the 2025-2026 NOVA Catalog, a credit at NOVA is equivalent to one collegiate semester hour. One credit is awarded for the following: one hour per week of lecture (15 hours per semester plus an exam period).
      C.  This Dual Enrollment class is a rigorous, college level course that will require sustained and consistent engagement from students. To ensure that students understand and are prepared for these expectations: 
           i.  All students are expected to read and sign a **DE Expectations Contract** at the beginning of the school year. For DE classes that span two semesters, a single contract at the beginning of the school year covers both.
          ii.  All students are expected to complete NOVA's DE student orientation by the end of the first week of classes. This orientation can be accessed at www.college2success.com/nvccdual/nvccdual . 
      D.  Our class works toward an industry certification. Students are expected to complete additional preparation outside of class for this certification. The score on the certification exam will impact student grades in this class, and passing the certification test is a major expectation of the class.
      E.  An average of 40 minutes of homework will be assigned for each 90 minutes in class. We will be utilizing a flipped classroom learning environment, where the lecture portion of the course material will be viewed individually at home before class meets, and  class time will be used for collaborative engagement and discussion.
            i. Frequent "reading quizzes" at the beginning of class will be used to ensure homework readings and practice have been completed.
           ii. To be successful in this class, students will be expected to be prepared for these quizzes before they arrive to class
          iii. Students who fail to take a reading quiz for any reason will receive a zero grade. Answers to the reading quiz are reviewed immediately in class, so makeups can not be provided. To account for occasional absences, the five lowest reading quiz grades from each semester will be dropped.
      G.  Our class follows college policies. Late work is not accepted, and retakes are not provided.
      H.  It is challenging (if not impossible) to determine whether code is generated using AI tools, peers, etc. For this reason, project grades will be structured in a way that emphasizes the code development process and understanding of the submitted code. Students will be graded on their git history, and will be asked to explain sections of their code live in class.
      I.  Students in this course produce real portfolio websites that are published on the public internet. Publishing personal information is not a requirement of the course, and students are responsible for the content that they choose to publish. This class will include frequent instruction and reflection about professionalism, digital citizenship, and digital footprints.


 IV.  How Grades are Earned 
      A.  Weighting:
          * Classwork/Homework Grades: 20%
          * Test/Project Grades: 60%
          * Final Exam: 20%

      B. Semester Schedule: As a dual-enrolled class, this course calculates grades
      based on work completed throughout the entire semester. Although a grade for each
      "quarter" will be reported on the APS report card, the grade book will not "reset"
      at the end of the quarter. Students will be instructed to think of quarter report
      cards as a progress report toward their semester grade.
